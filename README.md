# CT Lung Lesion Segmentation (COVID-19) with U-Net Variants  

Automatic segmentation of lung lesions from CT scans is a critical step in understanding disease progression and assisting clinicians in treatment planning. This project evaluates three deep learning architectures: **U-Net, Attention U-Net, and Residual U-Net** for COVID-19 lung lesion segmentation using preprocessing and augmentation techniques.

## Highlights
- **Dataset**: [COVID-19 CT Scan Lesion Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maedemaftouni/covid19-ct-scan-lesion-segmentation-dataset)

- **Models**:  
  - Traditional **U-Net**  
  - **Attention U-Net** (with attention gates to capture small lesions)  
  - **Residual U-Net** (skip + residual connections)  
- **Metrics**: Dice Coefficient, Validation Accuracy, IOU

##  Preprocessing
To improve lesion visibility and training efficiency:  
- Applied **CLAHE** (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)  
- **Gaussian smoothing** to reduce noise  
- Removed empty masks for cleaner training  
- Resized CT images ‚Üí `256√ó256` grayscale  
- Normalized pixel intensity values (0‚Äì1)  

---

## Data Augmentation
Since small lesions are harder to detect, augmentation focused on preserving them:  
- Horizontal & vertical flips  
- Random rotations  
- Scaling & slight translations  

This helped the models generalize better and reduced overfitting.

## üìä Results (Summary)
- **U-Net**: Strong baseline, struggled with small lesions  
- **Attention U-Net**: Best performance, captured both large and small lesions  
- **Residual U-Net**: Competitive results, but less consistent than Attention U-Net

## Significance & Future Work

**Significance:**  
- Supports development of **automated tools** for early and precise diagnosis of lung diseases like COVID-19.  
- Can **reduce manual workload** for radiologists and improve clinical efficiency.  

**Future Directions:**  
- Apply hybrid architectures and loss functions to improve **small lesion detection** and **boundary accuracy**.  
- Extend the approach to **other medical imaging datasets** to generalize applicability.
